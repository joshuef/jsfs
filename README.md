# SAFE JSFS

JS File Sync.

Currently POC. 

## Install

Clone the repo &: `yarn`.

Make a directory in the repo called `safeDrive`.

`yarn start` to run sync on this newly created folder.

## Caveats

All of them. 

This was whipped up fast and dirty and has only been roughly tested against SAFE mockrouting on osx.

Theoretically it should be cross platform. YMMV.

## Like this?
