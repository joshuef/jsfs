# SAFE JSFS

JS File Sync.

Currently POC. Only PUTs data, and probably not reliably.

## Install

Clone the repo &: `yarn`.

Make a directory in the repo called `safeDrive`.

`yarn start` to run sync on this newly created folder.


## Caveats

All of them. 

This was whipped up fast and dirty and has only been roughly tested against SAFE mockrouting on osx.

Theoretically it should be cross platform. YMMV.

## Like this?

Buy me some beer or a laptop or a house. (BTC/MAID donations so welcome: 1EmSUthDxBDfyJz1uXwpJtiVRpsgEWyzxB)

## License. 

Probably MIT.
